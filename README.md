# [Filturl](http://www.filturl.net)

Filturl is a slightly more advanced URL previewer that not only displays a screenshot of a URL, but also displays extra information such as:
* HTTP headers
* Source HTML
* IP address
* Number of redirects

It is, of course, not meant to replace best judgement, but rather to aid it, and currently only works for URLs that do not require authentication. It is just a fun little project I started because I habitually analyze "phishing" URLs that friends and family send me with a combination of utilities such as Lynx, wget and cURL, but have found that can get a little tedious over SSH clients on mobile devices.
