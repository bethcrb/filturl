Filturl is a slightly more advanced URL previewer that not only displays a screenshot of a URL, but also displays extra information such as:
* HTTP headers
* Source HTML
* IP address in addition to its location
* Redirection URLs

It is obviously not meant to replace best judgment, but rather to aid it, and currently only works for URLs that do not require authentication. It is just a fun little project that I started because I habitually analyze "phishing" URLs that friends and family send me with a combination of utilities such as Lynx, wget, and cURL, but have found that the process can get a little tedious when performed through SSH clients on mobile devices. It is also still very much in active development and nowhere near complete yet! I have many more features planned and a queue of bugs that I have been working on as time permits.
